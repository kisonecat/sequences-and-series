<p condition="p > 1">The series  \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{initial}}^\infty \frac{#{latex(term_x.numerator())}}{#{latex(variable**p)}}\) converges by the \(p\) series test; here \(p = #{latex(p)} &gt; 1\).</p>
<p condition="p > 1">We may conclude that the original series \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{initial}}^\infty #{latex(term)}\) converges absolutely.</p>

<p condition="p > 0 and p <= 1">Note that \(|a_{#{variable}}|\) is a decreasing sequence.</p>
<p condition="p > 0 and p <= 1">And \(\lim_{#{variable} \to \infty} a_{#{variable}} = 0\).</p>
